			AUTHOR'S PREFACE<br/>

			In which it is proved that, notwithstanding their names'
			ending in OS and IS, the heroes of the story which we are
			about to have the honor to relate to our readers have nothing
			mythological about them.<br/>
			A short time ago, while making researches in the Royal
			Library for my History of Louis XIV, I stumbled by chance
			upon the Memoirs of M. d'Artagnan, printed—as were most
			of the works of that period, in which authors could not tell
			the truth without the risk of a residence, more or less long,
			in the Bastille—at Amsterdam, by Pierre Rouge. The title
			attracted me; I took them home with me, with the permission
			of the guardian, and devoured them.<br/>
			It is not my intention here to enter into an analysis of
			this curious work; and I shall satisfy myself with referring
			such of my readers as appreciate the pictures of the period
			to its pages. They will therein find portraits penciled by the
			hand of a master; and although these squibs may be, for the
			most part, traced upon the doors of barracks and the walls
			of cabarets, they will not find the likenesses of Louis XIII,
			Anne of Austria, Richelieu, Mazarin, and the courtiers of
			the period, less faithful than in the history of M. Anquetil.
			But, it is well known, what strikes the capricious mind of
			the poet is not always what affects the mass of readers. Now,
			while admiring, as others doubtless will admire, the details 
			we have to relate, our main preoccupation concerned a matter
			to which no one before ourselves had given a thought.
			D'Artagnan relates that on his first visit to M. de Treville,
			captain of the king's Musketeers, he met in the antechamber
			three young men, serving in the illustrious corps into
			which he was soliciting the honor of being received, bearing
			the names of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.<br/>
			We must confess these three strange names struck us;
			and it immediately occurred to us that they were but pseudonyms,
			under which d'Artagnan had disguised names
			perhaps illustrious, or else that the bearers of these borrowed
			names had themselves chosen them on the day in
			which, from caprice, discontent, or want of fortune, they
			had donned the simple Musketeer's uniform.
			From the moment we had no rest till we could find some
			trace in contemporary works of these extraordinary names
			which had so strongly awakened our curiosity.<br/>
			The catalogue alone of the books we read with this object
			would fill a whole chapter, which, although it might be
			very instructive, would certainly afford our readers but little
			amusement. It will suffice, then, to tell them that at the
			moment at which, discouraged by so many fruitless investigations,
			we were about to abandon our search, we at length
			found, guided by the counsels of our illustrious friend Paulin
			Paris, a manuscript in folio, endorsed 4772 or 4773, we
			do not recollect which, having for title, ‘Memoirs of the
			Comte de la Fere, Touching Some Events Which Passed in
			France Toward the End of the Reign of King Louis XIII and
			the Commencement of the Reign of King Louis XIV.'
			It may be easily imagined how great was our joy when,
			in turning over this manuscript, our last hope, we found at
			the twentieth page the name of Athos, at the twenty-seventh
			the name of Porthos, and at the thirty-first the name
			of Aramis.<br/>
			The discovery of a completely unknown manuscript
			at a period in which historical science is carried to such a
			high degree appeared almost miraculous. We hastened,
			therefore, to obtain permission to print it, with the view of
			presenting ourselves someday with the pack of others at the
			doors of the Academie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres, if
			we should not succeed—a very probable thing, by the by—
			in gaining admission to the Academie Francaise with our
			own proper pack. This permission, we feel bound to say, was
			graciously granted; which compels us here to give a public
			contradiction to the slanderers who pretend that we live
			under a government but moderately indulgent to men of
			letters.<br/>
			Now, this is the first part of this precious manuscript
			which we offer to our readers, restoring it to the title which
			belongs to it, and entering into an engagement that if (of
			which we have no doubt) this first part should obtain the
			success it merits, we will publish the second immediately.
			In the meanwhile, as the godfather is a second father, we
			beg the reader to lay to our account, and not to that of the
			Comte de la Fere, the pleasure or the ENNUI he may experience.
			This being understood, let us proceed with our history.
